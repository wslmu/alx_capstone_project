Congratulations on reaching the final stage of the Intro to SWE course!
The capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply all the knowledge and skills you have acquired over the past 15 weeks and put into practice your new skillsets. In this concept page, we will introduce the idea of building your capstone project and provide you with 10 project options to choose from.


Project Objective:
The objective of the capstone project is to create a web development portfolio that demonstrates your skills, projects, and accomplishments. This portfolio will serve as a showcase of your abilities and will be a valuable asset in your web development journey. By completing the capstone project, you will have a comprehensive portfolio that reflects your progress, expertise, and readiness to take on more challenging web development projects.

Technologies required for the project
To prove your understanding of what you have learned over the past couple of months, you are expected to build a capstone project. You are restricted to the use of technologies of technologies taught in this program:

HTML
CSS
Python
Flask
MySQL
JavaScript
API
Git
Project Options:
You are expected to choose one of the following projects to build for your capstone project. Each project focuses on different aspects of web development and provides an opportunity to showcase your proficiency in specific areas.

Go through each of these and make a choice for what you would be building starting from next week for your capstone project. It is recommended that you choose a project that you are passionate about or solve a problem that you or people around you have.

Tasks
0. Create your capstone project's repo
mandatory
As yoiu get ready to start working on your capstone project, here are a few things that you are expected to do in anticipation to the start of your project.

Create a GitHub repository called alx_capstone_project
Inside this repository, create a README.md file
In the README.md file, write briefly on the following topics:
Project Overview:
Provide a brief description of the project, its purpose, and goals. Explain what problem the project aims to solve or what value it brings to users.
Features and Functionality:
List the main features and functionalities of the project. Describe how users can interact with the application and any notable aspects or unique selling points.
Technologies Used:
Specify the technologies, frameworks, and languages used in the project. This can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, specific libraries, or frameworks like Flask, and any other tools or services utilized.
Screenshots or Demo:
Include screenshots or a link to a live demo if available. Visual representations can help readers understand the project’s appearance and functionality.
Roadmap and future enhancements:
Share any future plans or potential improvements for the project. This could include additional features, performance optimizations, or scalability considerations.
Contact information:
Include your name, along with contact information or links to personal portfolios or social media profiles.
NB: You may have to update some of these details when the actual capstone project is released but for now, get the skeleton ready

2. Design Your Prototype
mandatory
After creating your workflow, proceed to develop the Prototype for your web application:

You have two options for the prototype (Low or high fidelity prototypes)
Select either a low or high fidelity prototype.
For a low fidelity prototype, consider using tools like draw.io.
For a high fidelity prototype with enhanced aesthetics, use Figma.

Recommended resource: Watch these video tutorials on prototyping:
